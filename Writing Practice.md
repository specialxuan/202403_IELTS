### IELTS 10 Test 1

These two pie char illustrate the proportion of energy usage and greenhouse gas emitted by them in a common Australian family.
The amount of greenhouse gas is mainly related to the percentage of which they are generated from, while there are some exceptions, both major and minor.

The most dominant part that Australian families spend their power on is heating, with 30% of total usage for water and more than two fifth for house.
In the meantime, the energy used for warming up water produces greenhouse gas at the same proportion approximately, while the figure for keeping room away from cold is only at 15%.

Less than a quarter of energy is consumed on refrigeration and other appliances, with the rest filled by cooling and lighting.
However, gas emission of these is doubled as percentage representatively, and overpass the heat appliances by a few percent.

In conclusion, heating accounts for the most proportion that Australian households use for, and also makes up a big part of greenhouse gas emissions, while the remaining power usage cost just one forth of total, but emit a little more than half of the gas.

  - Economy: hardware needed, not necessarily cheap

### Opening

- Intriguing, coherent, and clear

> It is hard to deny that (*opposite detail*), and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that (*opposite response*).
> However such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously
> As far as (*point 1*), (*point 2*), and (*point 3*) are concerned, I strongly hold that (*our response*).

### Reasoning

> First and foremost, (*point 1*), as (*fact 1-1*).
> For instance / To illustrate / To be more specific, (*fact 1-2*);
> In addition / not to mention that / Furthermore, (*fact 1-3*).
> (*option filler*).

- Optional Filler
  - Summary / conclusion / what if / a small example ...

### Exemplification

> Furthermore, the fact that (*point 2 mid level*) indicates that (*our response*).
> Take the case of (*character*), who / which (*process*). As a result, (*result*).
> Had it not been for (*process paraphrase*), (*character*) would never (*result paraphrase*).

### Concession

> Nevertheless, a voice arises that (*opposite response and point in grand opening*)
> Ironically, (*facts against opposite detail*)
> Therefore, (*point3*)

### Ending

> In a nutshell, I maintain that (*your response paraphrase*).
> Admittedly, as my favourite quote from (*a famous person*) goes, (*famous person says, people have different opinions*), and some people may oppose me.
> However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

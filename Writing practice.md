## Task 1

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emission

These two pie char illustrate the proportion of energy usage and greenhouse gas emitted by them in a common Australian family.
The amount of greenhouse gas is mainly related to the percentage of which they are generated from, while there are some exceptions, both major and minor.

The most dominant part that Australian families spend their power on is heating, with 30% of total usage for water and more than two fifth for house.
In the meantime, the energy used for warming up water produces greenhouse gas at the same proportion approximately, while the figure for keeping room away from cold is only at 15%.

Less than a quarter of energy is consumed on refrigeration and other appliances, with the rest filled by cooling and lighting.
However, gas emission of these is doubled as percentage representatively, and overpass the heat appliances by a few percent.

In conclusion, heating accounts for the most proportion that Australian households use for, and also makes up a big part of greenhouse gas emissions, while the remaining power usage cost just one forth of total, but emit a little more than half of the gas.

## Task 2

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Punishment for Children

It is hard to deny that exorbitant punishment may lead to mental and physical harm to children, and such a fact leads o impressionable people to generate the opinion that punitive measures should not be used to help kids learn how to distinct wrong from right.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as equality, culture, and feasible concerned, I strongly hold that punishment plays a key role in teaching children the difference between righteousness and wrongfulness.

First and foremost, punish children for making wrong decision will set a sense of equality in their premature mind, as where is reward for a good behavior, there is punishment for a bad one.
To be more specific, praise after kids' kindness will give them a message that you ought to do this again next time, and criticise after their faults will remind them not to repeat the mistake in the future.

## Task 1

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emission

These two pie char illustrate the proportion of energy usage and greenhouse gas emitted by them in a common Australian family.
The amount of greenhouse gas is mainly related to the percentage of which they are generated from, while there are some exceptions, both major and minor.

The most dominant part that Australian families spend their power on is heating, with 30% of total usage for water and more than two fifth for house.
In the meantime, the energy used for warming up water produces greenhouse gas at the same proportion approximately, while the figure for keeping room away from cold is only at 15%.

Less than a quarter of energy is consumed on refrigeration and other appliances, with the rest filled by cooling and lighting.
However, gas emission of these is doubled as percentage representatively, and overpass the heat appliances by a few percent.

In conclusion, heating accounts for the most proportion that Australian households use energy for, and also makes up a big part of greenhouse gas emissions, while the remaining power usage cost just one forth of total, but emit a little more than half of the gas.

### IELTS 10 Test 2 Sales of Coffee and Bananas

These two tables show how many Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas were sold in 1999 and 2004 in five European nations.
Among all five countries, sales of these two products generally grew in five years, while there were some exceptions.

A huge jump can be seen in coffee sales in UK, from 1.5 million euros in 1999 to 20 million euros in 2004, which made Britain the biggest consumer of coffee at the time.
The figures of coffee in other four nations saw a relatively moderate increase, no more than twice as much in 2004 compared to 1999 respectively.

The sales of bananas in Switzerland rose from 15 to 47 million euros during the time between 1999 and 2004, which was significantly larger than other countries.
There were drastic surge in the euros spent on bananas in UK and Belgium, the figures of whom in 2004 became around 6 times as that of 1999, while the rest two nations, Sweden and Denmark, saw a small dip in their figures of bananas in these five years.

In summary, UK and Switzerland consume more in both Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas than other countries in 1999, and widened the gap in 2004.

> The two tables contain sales data for Fairtrade coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004, in five nations of Europe.
>
> The first table shows low-level coffee sales increasing in all five countries, **albeit to widely degrees**.
> In two places sales increased by the same small amount: 1.8 - 2 million euros in Denmark, and 0.8 - 1 million in Sweden.
> The increment was slightly larger in Belgium, from 1 - 1.7 million euros. Meanwhile, in Switzerland sales doubled from 3 - 6 million euros.
> Finally, in the UK there was an enormous increase, from 1.5 - 20 million euros.
>
> In the second table, it is Switzerland which **stands out** as buying far more Fairtrade bananas than the other four countries.
> Swiss sales figures jumped from 15 - 47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1 - 5.5 and from 0.6 - 4 million euros respectively.
> Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in banana sales from 1.8 - 1and 2 - 0.9 million euros.
>
> Comparing the two tables, it is clear that in 1999 Fairtrade coffee sales **ranged from** 0.8 - 3 million euros in these five countries, while banana sales also mostly **clustered between** 0.6 and 2 million euros, with Switzerland the outlier at a huge 15 million euros.
> By 2004, sales figures for both products had risen across the board, except for Sweden and Demark which recorded drops in banana sales.

### IELTS 10 Test 3 Destination of UK Graduate and Postgraduate

The two bar chart illustrate the destinations (excluding full-time employment) of British graduate and postgraduate students after their graduation in 2008.
Some similarities are shared between figures of two kinds of students, while some exceptions exists.

Most popular orientation for graduates is further study, and about 30,000 students will improve themselves in college again after leaving it.
Figure of voluntary work is 3,500, only a tenth of that of further study, suggests that fewest students decide to become volunteer.
The rest two destination share about the same amount of students: 17,735 in part-time work, and 16,235 in unemployment.

The bar chart of postgraduate shows a similar pattern compared with that of graduates.
Apart from part-time work, the figures of other three destinations of former are about one out of ten compared to the latter: 345 in voluntary work, 2,725 in further study, and 1,625 in unemployment.
The proportion of part-time work postgraduate is, however, larger than that of graduate, its figure (2,535) is very close to further study.

In conclusion, most students, wether graduates or postgraduates, find themselves something to do after graduation, instead of being unemployed.

### IELTS 10 Test 4 Life of Salmon

The life of a salmon begins from a little beneath some small stones at the bottom of a river.
Salmon eggs are layed at the upper part of a river, for the water move slowly so that eggs will not be flushed away by the current.
Reeds above provide shelter for salmon eggs, and protect them 5-6 months until they become small fish.

Next, small fish, recently hatched, is called fry, and about 3-8 centimeters long.
These fish go to lower part of the river, where current is faster and able to provide them with more food to eat.
Around 4 years will be spent in the lower river for them to grow big enough, about 12-15 cm, and become smolt.

The final destination for salmon is open sea, where water is comfort and food is abundant.
It is going to take approximate half a decade for smolt to become adult salmon, which is as large as 70-76 cm.
After they are sexual mature, male and female salmon will mate, then return to the origin of the river, where they will lay eggs again, and the next life cycle fo salmon will start.

> Salmon begin life as eggs on a pebbly riverbed, hidden among reeds in the slow-moving upper reaches of a river.
> After five to six months the eggs **hatch into** 'fry'.
> For approximately the next four years, these baby salmon will live in the lower, faster-flowing waters of their river.
> During this time they **measure between three and eight centimetres in length**.
>
> By the time salmon reach twelve to fifteen centimetres, they are **termed** 'smolt', and at this time they **migrate** further downriver into the open sea.
> After five years at sea the salmon will have grown to adult size, which is between seventy and seventy-six centimetres.
> They then begin swimming back to their birthplace, where they will lay their eggs and cycle starts anew.
>
> In summary, the salmon **passes through** three distinct physical stages as it grows to maturity.
> Each of these stages takes place in a very different **aquatic location**.
> It is noteworthy that the first two stages of this fish's life occur in a freshwater environment, while the third stage is lived in saltwater.

## Task 2

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Punishment for Children

It is hard to deny that exorbitant punishment may lead to mental and physical harm to children, and such a fact leads to impressionable people to generate the opinion that punitive measures should not be used to help kids learn how to distinct wrong from right.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as equality, society, and feasible concerned, I strongly hold that punishment plays a key role in teaching children the difference between righteousness and wrongfulness.

First and foremost, punish children for making wrong decision will set a sense of equality in their premature mind, as where is reward for a good behavior, there is punishment for a bad one.
To be more specific, praise after kids' kindness will give them a message that you ought to do this again next time, and criticism after their faults will remind them not to repeat the mistake in the future.
Not to mention that, youngsters appreciated because they did the right thing after the penalty guides them to, will have a stronger impression of this experience, and will less likely go wrong again.

Furthermore, the fact that there will be punishment from morality or legislation, for adults who can't tell right from wrong in the society, indicates that there should be more or less punitive acts for children with same mistakes before they grow up.
For instance, the buglers who are sentenced by court to prison, may started their criminal life when they were young, and had no one to punish them for stopping the bad behavior.
Therefor, a little punishment at early stage could prevent kids from developing little crimes into big ones, which may damage the society and send them in jails.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that abused punishment may harm children in both mental and physical ways.
However, punishment contains more than humiliation or corporal punishment which are ineffective and harmful most of the time, and that means more effective and reasonable penalty, such as grounded or no TV for a week, can teach children a lesion without do any harm to their mind and body.
Therefore, punishment is a feasible approach to guide kids to become a better person.

In a nutshell, I maintain that punishment is a irreplaceable part for children to tell the difference from right and wrong.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
But I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

>One important stage in a child's growth is the development of a conscience, which is linked to the ability to tell right from wrong.
>This skill comes with time and good parenting, and my **firm conviction** is that punishment does not **have much of a role to play in** this.
>Therefor I have to disagree almost entirely with **the given statement**.
>
>To some extent the question depends on the age of the child.
>To punish a very young child is both wrong and foolish, as an infant will not understand what is happening or why **he or she** is being punished.
>Once the age of reason is reached however, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and **discourage** from bad.
>This kind but firm approach will achieve more than harsh punishments, which might entail many **negative consequences** unintended by the parents.
>
>To help a child learn the difference between right and wrong, teachers and parents should firstly provide good role modeling in their own behaviour.
>After that, if **sanctions** are needed, the punishment should not be of a physical nature, as that merely sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people to hit smaller ones - an outcome which **may well result** in the child starting to bully others.
>Nor should the punishment be in any way cruel.
>
>Rather, teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to **discipline** their young charges, such as detention, withdrawal of privileges, and time-out.
>Making the punishment fit the crime is a useful **notion**, which would see children being made to pick up rubbish they have dropped, clean up graffiti they have drawn, or apologise to someone they have hurt.
>In these ways responsibility is developed in the child, which leads to much better future behaviour than does punishment.

### IELTS 10 Test 2 What to Study in University

It is hard to deny that wasting too much energy and time in random subjects could impair students subjects for their major, and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that the subjects for college students should only be restricted to those that will be useful in the future.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as purpose of education, cultivation of abilities and improvement in efficiency are concerned, I strongly hold that students should study whatever their interests are.

First and foremost, purpose of education is not only to prepare a student to work, but also to make he or she a better person, as the ultimate wish of everyone is not to survive in a factory or company, but to live a happy life in the society, and that wish requires people to be highly educated, in many different disciplines.
For instance, people who wants to spend their lifespan in a healthy condition, will need some skills on sports and exercises, some knowledge on food and nutrition, and even a few tips on biology and medicine, all of which can be acquired in physical education and some other lessons in universities.
Furthermore, for most people, art class in college is probably the best way to cultivate impression and taste of art, which is fundamental need for anyone who is going to attend a concert or visit a gallery.
So missing these lessons may cause students face some unnecessary difficulties after they graduate.

Furthermore, the fact that everything can be useful in the unexpected ways indicates that stop students not to study subjects which are not expected to have any help in the future is not sensible.
Take the case of Steve Jobs, the fonder of Apple Inc, who once shared his experience in the speech for college graduation.
He learned about different types of fonts and what to do to make text more readable and look better, which later perform an important role in making apple's computer system much more beautiful than its competitors.
Had it not been for studying so called useless subjects, Jobs would never find it easy to build such a beautiful software.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that irrelevant subjects might consume so much energy and time supposed to be spend on major curriculums, and eventually prevent students to learn something really helpful.
Ironically, courses like art and sports can be one of the most efficient way to relax, which will only take a little amount of time to convert students' attention away from heavy burden, and then regenerate enough energy for them to get back and face next challenge.
Therefore, other subjects can improve the efficiency in studying related subjects, rather than impair it.

In a nutshell, I maintain that every people goes into universities should study whatever they intend to.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

### IELTS 10 Test 3 Buy Product Anywhere

It is hard to deny that a few countries's industries might get severe damaged, because the same products produced by more efficient foreign factories will outcompete domestic ones, and such fact lead to impressionable people to generate the opinion that globalization is a negative development for countries.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as globalization, efficiency, and economy are concerned, I strongly hold that forming of common market across the globe is a positive development for most countries.

First and foremost, globalization is the trend for 21st century, as connections between people different countries are strengthened because of the improvement in communications and logistics.
To illustrate, astounding new technology is developed everyday, in aviation, seafaring and other ways to travel around the world, makes it much easier for consumers in distant countries to buy the same products.
Not to mention that the same thing happens for producers, as the more areas good merchandise could be sold to, the more profits could be generated.

Furthermore, the fact that common market makes it possible to form an international production line, indicates that globalization can bring efficiency improvement for plenty countries at the same time.
Take the case of manufacturing of iPhone.
The design is fulfilled in America by talented engineers from Apple Inc, and then different parts are produced by companies in Korea, China and other nations, finally all components are gathered and assembled China or southeast Asian for shipment to everywhere across the world.
If some crucial elements of iPone were forbidden to buy in some countries, this cross-country production line would never be built in the first place.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that a better and more affordable product from another state could be more attractive than local ones, and did great harm to the industry in this country.
Ironically, the state can come up with a proper tariff, from which their manufacturers can be protected and beneficial competition that will boost domestic trade can also be introduced at the same time.
Therefore, foreign products are harmless, and can be a booster to native economy,  .

In a nutshell, I maintain that globalization is not a negative development for countries, but in contrary, a positive one.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

> It is said that countries are becoming similar to each other because of the global spread of the same products, which are now available for purchase almost anywhere.
> I strongly believe that this modern development is largely detrimental to culture and traditions worldwide.
>
> A country's history, language and ethos are all **inextricably** bound up in its manufactured artefacts.
> If the **relentless advance** of international brands into **every corner of the world countries**, these bland packages might one day completely oust the traditional objects of a nation, which would be a loss of **richness and diversity in the world**, as well as the sad disappearance of the manifestations of a place's character.
> What would a Japanese tea ceremony be without its specially crafted teapot, or a Fijian kava ritual without its bowl made from a certain type of tree bark?
>
> Let us not forget either that traditional products, whether these be medicines, cosmetics, toys, clothes, utensils or food, provide employment for local people.
> The spread of multinational products can often bring in its wake a loss of jobs, as people turn into buying the new brand, perhaps thinking it more glamorous than the one they are used to.
> This eventually puts old-school craftspeople out of work.
>
> Finally, tourism numbers may also be affected, as travellers become **disillusioned** with finding every place just the same as the one they visited previously.
> To see the same products in shops the world over is boring, and does not impel visitors to open their wallets in the same way that trinkets or souvenirs **unique to** the particular area do.
>
> Some may argue that all people are entitled to have access the the same products, but I say that local objects suit local conditions best, and that faceless uniformity worldwide is an unwelcome and dreary prospect.

### IELTS 10 Test 4 Charge for Museum

To deny that putting charge on people for admission to museums will help them pay their own bill is hard, and such fact lead to impressionable people to generate the idea that there are more benefits to charge visiters for museums than not to charge.
However, such an opinion suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as culture, feasibility and economy are concerned, I strongly hold that the advantage of charging people for visiting museums does not outweigh the disadvantage.

First and foremost, charging people will have a bad influence on cultural promotion, as a person's enthusiasm could be severely damaged by the price of the ticket, and miss the chance to encounter some new pieces of culture.
To be more specific, the basic function of a museum is to exhibit its belongings and tell stories from them, so that visitors can feel and understand the culture behind these tales.
And if the cost for the entrance prevent more people from the exhibition hall,  it will heavily affect the main reason why this building was erected in the first place.
So, in cultural aspect, the disadvantage is quiet clear.

Furthermore, the fact that the bill to maintain a museum to be functional is not very expensive indicates that it won't be a heavy burden for government budget to support it.
Take the Chinese National Museum for instance, the collection in it contains from paintings to metal antiques, which are durable and need little energy usage and human effort to conserve them, and that means it will only takes a small public expenditure of Beijing government to cover the bill.
As a result National Museum of China is free for tourist from all around the world, and tells Chinese culture to the entire globe.
Since running a museum won't cost much, the advantage of charging is marginal.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that it is a more sustainable way if the museum can feed itself with tickets fee.
Ironically, there are many other ways to get a decent income for museum apart from asking the public to hand over their money for their interest in culture, such as setting up stores of refreshments for people who are tired, and shops of souvenirs for people who are willing to pay.
Therefore, the advantage of charging becomes minimal.

In a nutshell, I maintain that the advantage of charging people for admission to museums is outweighed by the disadvantage.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

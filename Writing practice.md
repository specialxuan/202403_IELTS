## Task 1

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emission

These two pie char illustrate the proportion of energy usage and greenhouse gas emitted by them in a common Australian family.
The amount of greenhouse gas is mainly related to the percentage of which they are generated from, while there are some exceptions, both major and minor.

The most dominant part that Australian families spend their power on is heating, with 30% of total usage for water and more than two fifth for house.
In the meantime, the energy used for warming up water produces greenhouse gas at the same proportion approximately, while the figure for keeping room away from cold is only at 15%.

Less than a quarter of energy is consumed on refrigeration and other appliances, with the rest filled by cooling and lighting.
However, gas emission of these is doubled as percentage representatively, and overpass the heat appliances by a few percent.

In conclusion, heating accounts for the most proportion that Australian households use energy for, and also makes up a big part of greenhouse gas emissions, while the remaining power usage cost just one forth of total, but emit a little more than half of the gas.

### IELTS 10 Test2 Sales of coffee and bananas

These two table show how many Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas were sold in 1999 and 2004 in five European nations.
Among all five countries, sales of these two products generally grew in five years, while there were some exceptions.

A huge jump can be seen in coffee sales in UK, from 1.5 million euros in 1999 to 20 million euros in 2004, which made Britain the biggest consumer of coffee at the time.
The figures of coffee in other four nations saw a relatively moderate increase, no more than twice as much in 2004 compared to 1999 respectively.

The sales of bananas in Switzerland rose from 15 to 47 million euros during the time between 1999 and 2004, which is significantly larger than other countries.
There were drastic surge in the euros spent on bananas in UK and Belgium, the figures of whom in 2004 became around 6 times as that of 1999, while the rest two nations, Sweden and Denmark, saw a small dip in their figures of bananas in these five years.

In summary, UK and Switzerland consume more in both Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas than other countries in 1999, and widened the gap in 2004.

> The two tables contain sales data for Fairtrade coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004, in five nations of Europe.
>
> The first table shows low-level coffee sales increasing in all five countries, **albeit to widely degrees**.
> In two places sales increased by the same small amount: 1.8 - 2 million euros in Denmark, and 0.8 - 1 million in Sweden.
> The increment was slightly larger in Belgium, from 1 - 1.7 million euros. Meanwhile, in Switzerland sales doubled from 3 - 6 million euros.
> Finally, in the UK there was an enormous increase, from 1.5 - 20 million euros.
>
> In the second table, it is Switzerland which **stands out** as buying far more Fairtrade bananas than the other four countries.
> Swiss sales figures jumped from 15 - 47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1 - 5.5 and from 0.6 - 4 million euros respectively.
> Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in banana sales from 1.8 - 1and 2 - 0.9 million euros.
>
> Comparing the two tables, it is clear that in 1999 Fairtrade coffee sales **ranged from** 0.8 - 3 million euros in these five countries, while banana sales also mostly **clustered between** 0.6 and 2 million euros, with Switzerland the outlier at a huge 15 million euros.
> By 2004, sales figures for both products had risen across the board, except for Sweden and Demark which recorded drops in banana sales.

## Task 2

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Punishment for Children

It is hard to deny that exorbitant punishment may lead to mental and physical harm to children, and such a fact leads to impressionable people to generate the opinion that punitive measures should not be used to help kids learn how to distinct wrong from right.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as equality, society, and feasible concerned, I strongly hold that punishment plays a key role in teaching children the difference between righteousness and wrongfulness.

First and foremost, punish children for making wrong decision will set a sense of equality in their premature mind, as where is reward for a good behavior, there is punishment for a bad one.
To be more specific, praise after kids' kindness will give them a message that you ought to do this again next time, and criticism after their faults will remind them not to repeat the mistake in the future.
Not to mention that, youngsters appreciated because they did the right thing after the penalty guides them to, will have a stronger impression of this experience, and will less likely go wrong again.

Furthermore, the fact that there will be punishment from morality or legislation, for adults who can't tell right from wrong in the society, indicates that there should be more or less punitive acts for children with same mistakes before they grow up.
For instance, the buglers who are sentenced by court to prison, may started their criminal life when they were young, and had no one to punish them for stopping the bad behavior.
Therefor, a little punishment at early stage could prevent kids from developing little crimes into big ones, which may damage the society and send them in jails.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that abused punishment may harm children in both mental and physical ways.
However, sanctions contains more than humiliation or corporal punishment which are ineffective and harmful most of the time, and that means more effective and reasonable penalty, such as grounding in home or no TV for a week, can teach children a lesion effectively without do any harm to their mind and body.
Therefore, punishment is a feasible approach to guide kids to become a better person.

In a nutshell, I maintain that punishment is a irreplaceable part for children to tell the difference from right and wrong.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
But I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

>One important stage in a child's growth is the development of a conscience, which is linked to the ability to tell right from wrong.
>This skill comes with time and good parenting, and my **firm conviction** is that punishment does not **have much of a role to play in** this.
>Therefor I have to disagree almost entirely with **the given statement**.
>
>To some extent the question depends on the age of the child.
>To punish a very young child is both wrong and foolish, as an infant will not understand what is happening or why **he or she** is being punished.
>Once the age of reason is reached however, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and **discourage** from bad.
>This kind but firm approach will achieve more than harsh punishments, which might entail many **negative consequences** unintended by the parents.
>
>To help a child learn the difference between right and wrong, teachers and parents should firstly provide good role modeling in their own behaviour.
>After that, if **sanctions** are needed, the punishment should not be of a physical nature, as that merely sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people to hit smaller ones - an outcome which **may well result** in the child starting to bully others.
>Nor should the punishment be in any way cruel.
>
>Rather, teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to **discipline** their young charges, such as detention, withdrawal of privileges, and time-out.
>Making the punishment fit the crime is a useful **notion**, which would see children being made to pick up rubbish they have dropped, clean up graffiti they have drawn, or apologise to someone they have hurt.
>In these ways responsibility is developed in the child, which leads to much better future behaviour than does punishment.

### IELTS 10 Test 2 What to Study in University

It is hard to deny that wasting too much energy and time in random subjects could impair students subjects for their major, and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that the subjects for college students should only be restricted to those that will be useful in the future.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as purpose of education, cultivation of abilities and improvement in efficiency are concerned, I strongly hold that students should study whatever their interests are.

First and foremost, purpose of education is not only to prepare a student to work, but also to make he or she a better person, as the ultimate wish of everyone is not to survive in a factory or company, but to live a happy life in the society, and that wish requires people to be highly educated, in many different disciplines.
For instance, people who wants to spend their lifespan in a healthy condition, will need some skills on sports and exercises, some knowledge on food and nutrition, and even a few tips on biology and medicine, all of which can be acquired in physical education and some other lessons in universities.
Furthermore, for most people, art class in college is probably the best way to cultivate impression and taste of art, which is fundamental need for anyone who is going to attend a concert or visit a gallery.
So missing these lessons may cause students face some unnecessary difficulties after they graduate.

Furthermore, the fact that everything can be useful in the unexpected ways indicates that stop students not to study subjects which are not expected to have any help in the future is not sensible.
Take the case of Steve Jobs, the fonder of Apple Inc, who once shared his experience in the speech for college graduation.
He learned about different types of fonts and what to do to make text more readable and look better, which later perform an important role in making apple's computer system much more beautiful than its competitors.
Had it not been for studying so called useless subjects, Jobs would never find it easy to build such a beautiful software.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that irrelevant subjects might consume so much energy and time supposed to be spend on major curriculums, and eventually prevent students to learn something really helpful.
Ironically, courses like art and sports can be one of the most efficient way to relax, which will only take a little amount of time to convert students' attention away from heavy burden, and then regenerate enough energy for them to get back and face next challenge.
Therefore, other subjects can improve the efficiency in studying related subjects, rather than impair it.

In a nutshell, I maintain that every people goes into universities should study whatever they intend to.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

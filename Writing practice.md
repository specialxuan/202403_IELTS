## Task 1

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emission

These two pie char illustrate the proportion of energy usage and greenhouse gas emitted by them in a common Australian family.
The amount of greenhouse gas is mainly related to the percentage of which they are generated from, while there are some exceptions, both major and minor.

The most dominant part that Australian families spend their power on is heating, with 30% of total usage for water and more than two fifth for house.
In the meantime, the energy used for warming up water produces greenhouse gas at the same proportion approximately, while the figure for keeping room away from cold is only at 15%.

Less than a quarter of energy is consumed on refrigeration and other appliances, with the rest filled by cooling and lighting.
However, gas emission of these is doubled as percentage representatively, and overpass the heat appliances by a few percent.

In conclusion, heating accounts for the most proportion that Australian households use energy for, and also makes up a big part of greenhouse gas emissions, while the remaining power usage cost just one forth of total, but emit a little more than half of the gas.

### IELTS 10 Test2 Sales of coffee and bananas

These two tables show how many Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas were sold in 1999 and 2004 in five European nations.
Among all five countries, sales of these two products generally grew in five years, while there were some exceptions.

A huge jump can be seen in coffee sales in UK, from 1.5 million euros in 1999 to 20 million euros in 2004, which made Britain the biggest consumer of coffee at the time.
The figures of coffee in other four nations saw a relatively moderate increase, no more than twice as much in 2004 compared to 1999 respectively.

The sales of bananas in Switzerland rose from 15 to 47 million euros during the time between 1999 and 2004, which was significantly larger than other countries.
There were drastic surge in the euros spent on bananas in UK and Belgium, the figures of whom in 2004 became around 6 times as that of 1999, while the rest two nations, Sweden and Denmark, saw a small dip in their figures of bananas in these five years.

In summary, UK and Switzerland consume more in both Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas than other countries in 1999, and widened the gap in 2004.

>The two tables **contain** sales date for Fairtrade coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004, in five nations of Europe.
>
>The first table shows low-level coffee sales increasing in all five countries, **albeit** to widely varying degrees. In two places sales increased by the same small amount: 1.8-2 million euros in Denmark, and 0.8-1 million in Sweden.
>The increment was slightly larger in Belgium, from 1-1.7 million euros.
>Meanwhile, in Switzerland sales doubled from 3-6 million euros.
>Finally, in the UK there was an **enormous** increase, from 1.5-20 million euros.
>
>In the second table, it is Switzerland which **stands out** as buying far more Fairtrade bananas than the other countries.
>Swiss sales figures jumped from 15-47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1-5.5 and from 0.6-4 million euros respectively.
>Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in banana sales from 1.8-1 and 2-0.9 million euros.
>
>Comparing the two tables, it is clear that in 1999 Fairtrade coffee sales ranged from 0.8-3 million euros in these five countries, while banana sales also mostly **clustered** between 0.6 and 2 million euros, with Switzerland the outlier at a huge 15 million euros.
>By 2004, sales figures for both products ahd risen across the board, expect for Sweden and Demark which recorded drops in banana sales.

## Task 2

### IELTS 10 Test 1 Punishment for Children

It is hard to deny that exorbitant punishment may lead to mental and physical harm to children, and such a fact leads to impressionable people to generate the opinion that punitive measures should not be used to help kids learn how to distinct wrong from right.
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as equality, society, and feasible concerned, I strongly hold that punishment plays a key role in teaching children the difference between righteousness and wrongfulness.

First and foremost, punish children for making wrong decision will set a sense of equality in their premature mind, as where is reward for a good behavior, there is punishment for a bad one.
To be more specific, praise after kids' kindness will give them a message that you ought to do this again next time, and criticism after their faults will remind them not to repeat the mistake in the future.
Not to mention that, youngsters appreciated because they did the right thing after the penalty guides them to, will have a stronger impression of this experience, and will less likely go wrong again.

Furthermore, the fact that there will be punishment from morality or legislation, for adults who can't tell right from wrong in the society, indicates that there should be more or less punitive acts for children with same mistakes before they grow up.
For instance, the buglers who are sentenced by court to prison, may started their criminal life when they were young, and had no one to punish them for stopping the bad behavior.
Therefor, a little punishment at early stage could prevent kids from developing little crimes into big ones, which may damage the society and send them in jails.

Nevertheless, a voice arises that abused punishment may harm children in both mental and physical ways.
However, punishment contains more than humiliation or corporal punishment which are ineffective and harmful most of the time, and that means more effective and reasonable penalty, such as grounded or no TV for a week, can teach children a lesion without do any harm to their mind and body.
Therefore, punishment is a feasible approach to guide kids to become a better person.

In a nutshell, I maintain that punishment is a irreplaceable part for children to tell the difference from right and wrong.
Admittedly, as my favorite quote from James Madison goes, as long as the reason of man continues fallible, different opinions will be formed, and some people may oppose me.
But I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.
